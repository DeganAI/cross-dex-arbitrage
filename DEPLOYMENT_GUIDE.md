# Deployment Guide for Cross DEX Arbitrage Alert

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (gh)

```bash
cd /Users/kellyborsuk/Documents/gas/files-2/cross-dex-arbitrage

# Login to GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Create repository
gh repo create cross-dex-arbitrage --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Repository will be created at: https://github.com/DeganAI/cross-dex-arbitrage
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `cross-dex-arbitrage`
3. Description: "Real-time arbitrage opportunity detection across multiple DEXs"
4. Select "Public"
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

Then push your code:

```bash
cd /Users/kellyborsuk/Documents/gas/files-2/cross-dex-arbitrage

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/DeganAI/cross-dex-arbitrage.git

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Initial Setup

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository: `DeganAI/cross-dex-arbitrage`
5. Railway will detect the railway.toml and Dockerfile automatically

### Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
PORT=8000
BASE_URL=https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app
PAYMENT_ADDRESS=0x01D11F7e1a46AbFC6092d7be484895D2d505095c
FREE_MODE=true

# RPC URLs (REQUIRED - Use public RPCs or your own)
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://eth.llamarpc.com
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
OPTIMISM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.optimism.io
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org
AVALANCHE_RPC_URL=https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

### Generate Domain

1. In Railway project settings
2. Go to "Settings" > "Networking"
3. Click "Generate Domain"
4. Domain should be: `cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app`
5. Update `BASE_URL` environment variable if domain is different

### Wait for Deployment

Railway will automatically:
1. Build Docker image
2. Deploy the application
3. Run health checks
4. Make service available on generated domain

Monitor deployment logs in Railway dashboard.

## Step 3: Test Endpoints

Once deployed, test all required endpoints:

### Test agent.json (must return 200)

```bash
curl -I https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app/.well-known/agent.json

# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### Test x402 metadata (must return 402)

```bash
curl -I https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app/.well-known/x402

# Expected: HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
```

### Test entrypoint (must return proper response)

```bash
curl -X POST https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app/entrypoints/cross-dex-arbitrage/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token_in": "USDC",
    "token_out": "USDT",
    "amount_in": "1000",
    "chains": [137, 8453]
  }'
```

### Test health endpoint

```bash
curl https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app/health

# Expected: {"status":"healthy","available_chains":7,"chain_ids":[...],"free_mode":true}
```

### Test main arbitrage endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app/arbitrage \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token_in": "USDC",
    "token_out": "USDT",
    "amount_in": "1000",
    "chains": [137, 42161, 8453]
  }'
```

## Step 4: Verify Accuracy (<1% Requirement)

Test with known token pairs and compare results with actual on-chain quotes:

```bash
# Test USDC -> USDT on Polygon
curl -X POST https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app/arbitrage \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token_in": "USDC",
    "token_out": "USDT",
    "amount_in": "1000",
    "chains": [137]
  }' | jq

# Compare effective_price with actual DEX quotes
# Verify gas_cost_usd matches current network gas costs
# Ensure spread calculations are within 1% of reality
```

## Step 5: Register on x402scan

1. Go to https://www.x402scan.com/resources/register
2. Enter full entrypoint URL: `https://cross-dex-arbitrage-production.up.railway.app/entrypoints/cross-dex-arbitrage/invoke`
3. Leave headers blank
4. Click "Add"
5. Verify it appears on https://www.x402scan.com
6. Should show "Resource Added" confirmation

## Step 6: Create Submission File

Create submission file in agent-bounties repository:

```bash
cd /Users/kellyborsuk/Documents/gas/files-2/agent-bounties

# Create submissions directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p submissions

# Create submission file
cat > submissions/cross-dex-arbitrage.md << 'EOF'

## Troubleshooting

### If endpoints return 404

- Check Railway deployment logs
- Verify BASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
- Ensure all RPC_URL environment variables are configured

### If agent.json returns wrong status code

- Must return 200, not 402
- Check main.py @app.get("/.well-known/agent.json") endpoint

### If x402 returns wrong status code

- Must return 402, not 200
- Check main.py @app.get("/.well-known/x402") endpoint

### If x402scan registration fails

- Verify entrypoint URL is exact and includes /invoke
- Check that x402 metadata endpoint returns all required fields
- Test endpoint manually with curl first

### If accuracy is off

- Verify RPC URLs are working (check Railway logs)
- Test 0x API access from Railway environment
- Compare gas costs with actual network gas trackers
- Check CoinGecko API for token price accuracy
